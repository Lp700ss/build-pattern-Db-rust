# build-pattern-Db-rust
In this example, we define a Databaseconnection struct and a corresponding
DatabaseConnectionBuilder struct. The builder allows step-by-step construction of a
DatabaseConnection instance, abstracting away the construction details.
This separation of concerns enhances code clarity and enables easy creation of objects with
varying configurations. The main function demonstrates how to use the builder to create a
customized DatabaseConnection object.
